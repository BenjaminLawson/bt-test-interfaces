# Bluetooth Test Interfaces Summary

The Bluetooth test interfaces are Remote Procedure Call (RPC) interfaces
exposed to testing tools to trigger behaviors within a Bluetooth stack under
test. They are built using the following [requirements](
blueberry/reference/doc/overview) and [style guide](
blueberry/reference/doc/style-guide).

A test interface is defined for each Bluetooth profile. They currently include:

* **Host API**: work in progress.
* **A2DP API**: work in progress.
